# Streak Management Features

## Delete Streak Feature

### Overview
Users can now delete individual streaks with a comprehensive warning system to prevent accidental deletions.

### How It Works

#### 1. Delete Button
- Located in the top-right corner of each streak card
- Red trash icon for clear visual indication
- Hover state shows intent clearly

#### 2. Warning Dialog
- **Title**: "Delete Streak" with warning icon
- **Content**: Shows specific streak name being deleted
- **Warning Message**: "This action cannot be undone. All your progress and achievements for this streak will be permanently lost."
- **Actions**: Cancel (safe) and Delete Streak (destructive)

#### 3. Visual Design
- Red color scheme for destructive action
- Clear hierarchy with prominent cancel option
- Backdrop blur for focus
- Icon reinforcement for clarity

### User Experience Flow
1. User clicks red trash icon on streak card
2. Warning dialog appears with specific streak details
3. User must confirm deletion with explicit "Delete Streak" button
4. On confirmation, streak and all associated data is permanently removed
5. User returns to dashboard with updated streak list

### Edit Functionality
- Blue edit icon next to delete button
- Opens streak form with pre-filled data
- Allows modification of all streak properties

## Stats Section Repositioning

### New Location
The stats section (Total Streaks, Longest Streak, Total Completions) has been moved:
- **Previous**: Bottom of the page after all streaks
- **Current**: Top of the page, right after the welcome section and before the streak cards

### Benefits
1. **Immediate Overview**: Users see their progress summary immediately
2. **Better Context**: Stats provide context before viewing individual streaks
3. **Improved Flow**: Natural progression from welcome → stats → detailed streaks
4. **Motivation**: Achievement numbers motivate users before they interact with streaks
